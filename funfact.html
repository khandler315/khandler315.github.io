		<h3>I went skydiving this summer</h3>
		<p> I am a dare devil and love new thrilling adventures. I went skydiving in Tel, Aviv Israel with four of my friends. This was the coolest experience of my life as I was 1,100 ft off the ground. The initial jump out of the plane was scary, however after a few seconds free falling felt incredible. For anyone that enjoys crazy adventures like me, I would highly reccomend skydiving. </p>
